## Overview

In Somalia, low immunization coverage rates are attributed to various factors such as forgetfulness, lack of vaccine awareness, mobility challenges, and negative community beliefs. This project aims to overcome these challenges by creating a comprehensive data recording system that collects, stores, and analyzes data related to children who miss vaccines. This information, along with their contact details and specific regions, will be utilized to improve immunization program efficiency.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution involves the implementation of an Internet of Things (IOT) system that incorporates a fingerprint-based identification system. This system will utilize the mother's fingerprint and other relevant details of the child to record immunization data. The recorded data will be securely stored in a centralized database. Subsequently, the data will be analyzed and presented through an intuitive dashboard.

## Features

- **Fingerprint-based Identification:** The system uses the mother's fingerprint and child's details for accurate data recording.
- **Centralized Database:** All recorded data is securely stored in a centralized database, ensuring easy access and management.
- **Data Analysis:** The system analyzes the collected data to identify areas with low vaccination rates and aid in creating targeted awareness campaigns.
- **Dashboard:** An interactive dashboard provides program officers and NGOs with valuable insights for data-driven decision-making.

## Installation

To install the system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/immunization-iot-system.git`
2. Install the required dependencies by running: `npm install`
3. Configure the database connection in `config.js`.
4. Run the system: `node app.js`

## Usage

Once the system is up and running, healthcare workers and program officers can use the IOT devices to record immunization data. The collected data will be accessible through the dashboard for analysis and decision-making.

## Data Security

Data security is a top priority for this project. All sensitive data, including fingerprints and personal information, will be encrypted and stored following industry best practices.

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides a visual representation of immunization data. It highlights areas with low vaccination rates, displays historical trends, and assists in planning targeted awareness campaigns.
